Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?

I will keep improving on this part because I like to edit on one document without saving them. So I need to develop a habit of doing this. 

How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?

The commit messages are very effective since it is important to keep track of what you wrote each day or period. 

How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?

This process can be similar to my english essays because I am not someone who writes 2 or 3 drafts. I always write just one draft and it is difficult to keep track of the progress of one document since google doc is not very good at keeping track of things.
